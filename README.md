## Description
Hello! My name is Farhan, and I'm a web developer. I'm excited to share with you my latest creation - a 3D hover effect using just HTML and CSS! With this effect, when the user hovers over an image, it will pop up and reveal a description. It's a simple yet effective way to add a touch of interactivity and make your website or project more visually engaging.

## Project Details
The project is a showcase of a 3D hover effect created using HTML and CSS. When the user hovers over an image, it pops up and displays a description. The effect is achieved by applying CSS properties to the container, image, and description. The container's position is set to relative, and a transition property is added to give a smooth animation. On hover, the transform property is changed on the image and description to create the 3D effect. Lastly, some CSS styling is added to make the description look visually appealing.
## How to Use
You can use this 3D hover effect by following the code snippet provided above. Simply replace the image source and description with your own content, and adjust the width and height properties of the container to fit your image size.
## Conclusion
I hope this 3D hover effect using just HTML and CSS will inspire you to add more interactivity to your projects. Feel free to use and modify the code as you like, and don't forget to give credit where credit is due. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks for checking out my project!
